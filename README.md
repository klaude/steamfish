A Server-side Q4Max Updater
===========================

A few years back I worked in professinoal gaming doing IT tasks for a now defunct leage called the Cyberathlete Professional League through my job at Insomnia365. One year Quake 4 was the CPL's 1v1 tournament game. A competition mod called Q4Max eventually came out to support it, and a client-side updater called Steamfish soon followed so the players could keep Q4Max up to date. I wrote a server-side shell script that did the same thing for those running Q4Max competition servers.

I found this old script while rummaging through an old file server and decided to put it up here for posterity's sake, warts and all.
